hello = world
cookies = chocolate chip, oatmeal, peanut butter
poem = The Assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold,\
       And his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold;\
       And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea,\
       When the blue wave rolls nightly on deep Galilee.
