        Unfortunately we don't have a reliable, efficient way of avoiding this task if it doesn't need
        to be run. At the time of writing, changesets themselves can't set properties, and doing a limited
        lookup would still require performing the joins and much of the work of the update query such
        that it's overall quicker to just do the update rather than looking for data to fix first.

            Impl note:
            We can't safely use an IN statement here, since it's reasonable/expected for there to be
            more pools than the IN-clause size limit would allow
